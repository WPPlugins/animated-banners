HTML Animated Banners plugin was developed by [Acumen](http://www.acumendevelopment.net/ "Acumen Development")
in order to provide an easy way to generate sharp, eye-catching animations based on HTML and uploaded images.

Once the plugin is installed, you will have a new Widget shown in the Appearance > Widgets admin area, which you'll be able to
